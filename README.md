## Description <a name="description"></a>
A command line app that can be used to access and manipulate a databse of employees in a company.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
To install, begin by cloning the repository. Then navigate to the repo in your CLI and run "npm i". Once this is complete, enter your MySQL username and password into the ".env.EXAMPLE" file and rename it to ".env". Finally, start your MySQL shell and run "source assets/db/schema.sql". If you would like to use the stock database, run "source assets/db/seeds.sql" to seed the databse. The application is now ready to run.

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>
To use the application, run "node index.js" in the CLI, and then follow the prompts to view or edit the database! A demo of how to use the app can be found [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FdLEmZuYRvdORskhGX806MVM8AEXJzaR/view)
